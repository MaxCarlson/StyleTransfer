# Style Transfer

This repository contains the implementation of a Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- **StyleTransfer.py**: The main Python script implementing the style transfer.
- **StyleTransfer.sln**: The solution file for use with development environments.
- **StyleTransfer.pyproj**: The project file for Python projects in Visual Studio.

## How to Install

To install the dependencies, use the following command:

    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

## How to Run

To run the project, execute the following command:

    
    python StyleTransfer.py
  

Ensure that your Python environment has access to GPU for PyTorch (if applicable) or set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to configure GPU usage.
